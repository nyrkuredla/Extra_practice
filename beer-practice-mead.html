    <h1>Storm King stout</h1>
    <p class="review">Dark, lovely, luscious. The deep, dark brown color hints at the flavors within. With an aroma reminiscent of chocolate and freshly baked cookies, this beer is smooth, silky, creamy, full-bodied, roasty, toasty, and slightly nutty. This is one beautifully balanced, rich, and exquisite stout.</p>

    <p class="review">Arriving in a 22-ounce brown bomber, this ale clocks in at 62 IBUs, which tells us there is a substantial amount of hops here, and a hefty 7.9 percent alcohol by volume speaks for itself. Decent amount of foam that holds together to form a chunky-looking head with good retention. Crystal-clear copper hue. Juicy aroma, pear-like fruity esters, rosewater, soft herbal tones and a hint of spicy alcohol in the back. Full-bodied with a syrupy mouthfeel, very smooth and creamy. Loads of hop oil up front, herbal, almost like nectar. Really juicy with an intermingled fruitiness of mango, pear and melon. Then the fruity esters show their real source with a warmth and spice of balanced alcohol; and bitterness has a go on the taste buds with a semi-puckering dryness. The malt character drops in fashionably late with undertones of toasted biscuit. The finish is a tad sweet, though if the hops fade with a bit of age and the alcohol goes a bit vinous, then, with time, this beer will turn into a different beast altogether.</p>

    <p class="review">Naturally soured by farm valley winds blowing wild yeast into our oak casks. Finally, after a year and a half of patient coaxing Wisconsin dark malts whirl in a kaleidoscope of cedar, caramel and tart green plum exuberance. Available to the exclusive few who travel off the beaten paths, this is authentic Wisconsin sour brown ale. Truly unique this Sour Ale is brewed for those who live on the wild side and is suitable for laying down or consuming immediately, serve at 40 – 45 °F.
