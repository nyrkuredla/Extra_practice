      <h1>A simple question: how do children acquire language?</h1>

      <p>Linguistics is a very young field, when compared to other scientific fields like physics or chemistry, and many questions are still unanswered. One of the most basic questions is, how do small children learn to speak their native language? There still isn’t one answer which everyone agrees on, but most linguists do agree that it is an essential question to answer in order to understand how language works. If we can understand how children learn their native language, we can gain better understanding of other related ideas: how language is structured; where in the brain language is located; how language learning affects or is affected by other skills that children learn, and so on. There is a lot that we know about the “what” of child language learning, but we still don’t know the “how” or the “why”. There have been several attempts at an explanation; two of the most influential have been behavioralism and Universal Grammar (UG). </p>

      <h2>Early approaches: behavioralism</h2>
      <p>Until about fifty years ago, it was widely believed (and still is, by some!) that native language skills are created from a series of habits which are developed at a young age; parents demonstrate the proper way to speak, and guide their children to copy their example. For example, when a child says words in the wrong order, or uses the wrong form of a word in a sentence, the child is corrected by their parents or another adult who already speaks the language fluently. The child learns from this mistake, and over a longer time, and after many (many, many) mistakes and corrections, children eventually learn the proper way to speak.</p>

      <p>According to the “mistake / correction” idea of language acquisition (called /behavioralism/), we would expect children to copy their parents’ language as closely as possible; as they are corrected more and more, their speech becomes more and more similar to their parents’ speech until the children are fully fluent. And in fact, this is how many important skills are developed: learning by example and correction, children learn how to get dressed, how to play games and do housework. </p>

      <p>However, in practice, there are a few problems with this assumption when it comes to language learning. </p>

      <p>First of all, many children make mistakes that do not make sense according to this model. We might expect, for example, that children would first learn easier concepts (“baby talk”), and then continue on to more complex structures only when they have mastered the basics. Adults do learn this way when they are learning a foreign language, but children learning their native language do not. For example, a child might say,</p>

      <q>Can I put my head in the mailbox so the mailman can know where I are and put me in the mailbox?</q> <cite>(Pinker, 1994)</cite>

      <p>Here, the child has made a simple mistake of verb agreement; they should have said, “…so the mailman can know where I am”. The behavioralist model cannot explain this, for a few reasons. First, why has the child made a mistake in verb agreement when they have never heard such a mistake before? Fluent adults who speak to babies do not make this mistake, and so there is no way that the child would have heard it and tried to copy it. Secondly, the child has correctly used subordinate clauses, modal verbs and other “high-level” language structures with no difficulty. How, then, have they made such a basic and “easy” mistake, when the other more complicated structures are no problem?</p>

      <p>Another fundamental question which behavioralism cannot answer is the problem of creativity. Language is infinitely creative; this means that it is possible to use the “building blocks” of language (words, for example) to create an infinite number of unique sentences. In fact, we create unique sentences all the time, without realizing it! This creative quality is fundamental to language; it is what allows people to communicate in a complex way and to share new ideas with each other. </p>

      <p>Anyone who has spoken with children knows that they have some unique and interesting things to say that are often amusing or surprising to adults. But how is this possible? If children learn speech directly from adults, wouldn’t they just repeat what they have heard adults say?</p>

      <p>In summary, behavioralism doesn’t fully explain the ways in which children acquire their native language; another model is needed. Even now, we don’t have a model with all of the answers, but many linguists see Chomsky’s Universal Grammar model as a further step in the right direction.</p>

      <h2>Next steps: Chomsky’s Universal Grammar</h2>
      <p>Noam Chomsky is one of the most influential linguists to have considered this question, and he saw the same essential problems with the behavioral model of language acquisition. What if, he wondered, children learn how to speak in the same way that they learn how to see, or walk? In the same way that humans have eyes, and portions of the brain that are responsible for sight, might there be a “language organ”, and portions of the brain responsible for language? Using this idea, Chomsky began to develop the idea that eventually became Universal Grammar (UG). </p>

      <h1>Universal Grammar and the language organ</h1>
      <p>One way to think about the “language organ” is to think of a huge series of switches, similar to what telephone operators used to use. All children have the same initial switchboard, or “universal grammar”, and when a child is born, the switches are at a “default” or “null” setting. As the child gets more language input, the “switches” are flipped either on or off. These “switches” include settings for pronunciation, word order, semantics, and so on. As more and more switches are flipped, the child gains more skill in their native language, until all of the switches have been flipped and the child is fully fluent. The question is, then, what do the switches do exactly, and how do they get flipped?</p>
