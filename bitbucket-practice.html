            <p>You are about to use a whole bunch of Git and non-Git commands from a terminal. If you've never used the command line before, learn where to find it at The Command Line Crash Course.</p>

            <h2>Step 1. Clone your repository to your local system</h2>
            <p>Open a browser and a terminal window from your desktop. After opening the terminal window, do the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Navigate to your home (~) directory.</li>
                <li>Create a directory to contain your repositories.</li>
                <li>From the terminal, update the directory you want to work in to your new repos directory.</li>
                <li>From Bitbucket, go to your BitbucketStationLocations repository.</li>
                <li>Click Clone.</li> 
                <li>Copy the highlighted clone command.</li>
                <li>From your terminal window, paste the command you copied from Bitbucket and press Return.</li>
                <li>Enter your Bitbucket password when the terminal asks for it. If you created an account by linking to Google, use your password for that account.</li>
